 * This program is used to create a new instance of a BST (Binary search tree)
 * or an RBT (Red Black Tree). This program accepts input from the Linux
 * command line terminal. The user provides a text file which is arranged into
 * a tree data structure and assigned the properties of a red-black tree
 * according to the properties of maintaining a correct RBT.
 * 
 * This file is also responsible for printing/displaying important properties
 * of the instantiated BST or RBT. Including but not limited to tree search 
 * time, fill completion time, and the number if word returned as
 * unidentifiable.

 * This variable holds the name of the text file that is being read as input

 * structure of either a binary search tree or a red-black tree. The variable 
 * argc represents the total number of command-line arguments

 * This variable is the character which the program user enters to perform a 
 * specific operation in the newly created data structure. The variable argv
 * is and an array of strings that contain the command line process
